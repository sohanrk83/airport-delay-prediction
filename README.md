Final project for I310D: Human-Centered Data Science: predicting high-delay months at major U.S. airports

Group Members: Neera, Maanya, Sohan

Instructor: Professor Abhijit Mishra

Course: Human-Centered Data Science (Fall 2025)

# Project Overview

This project predicts high-delay months at major U.S. airports (ATL, DEN, DFW, LAX, ORD) using Logistic Regression and a simple MLP. We evaluate accuracy, fairness across airports, seasonal patterns, and model interpretability using LIME.
